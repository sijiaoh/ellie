# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

- Ruby version  
  See `.ruby-version`

- Database creation  
  `rails db:start` to create mysql in docker.

- Database initialization  
  `rails db:migrate`

- How to run the test suite  
  `./bin/test`

- Deployment instructions  
  TODO

- Notes  
  As the system test does not seem to support the turbo_method option, button_to is used for requests other than GET.
